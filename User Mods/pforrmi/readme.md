Its basically the same mod as from VIN-y.

Just in addition it is changed to use with 4mm dowel pin and 4x6x6 bushings. Like the one's you may already used for tapchanger or stealthchanger. So you don't have to buy any other stuff for this mod here.

You may need to clear the holes with 4mm and 6mm drill out for best clearance and easy push in fit!
